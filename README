Initial:
-Hi 
-Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when playing a new video without subs, after exiting a video with subs
-Fixed: "Return to Gui" and starting a video leads to crash 
-Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played 
This fix is done via mplayer.conf by adding:
[extension.avi]
demuxer=avi
-Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons 
-Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting your first video, after that you need to restart before it takes effect
This is quite simple really, have 3 different fonts sizes from mplayerhq's site. This is temporary until the subscale can be implemented with subfont.ttf
-Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui) <--- CHANGED, see 05/08/2012

24/07/2012:
-Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (using y and then exit!)

26/07/2012:
-Fixed: When entering a new folder "Item number/All item number" will not update until moving down on d-pad

29/07/2012:
-Fixed: When paused, the osd buttons (y, xbox, x) unpauses video, only "a" pauses/unpauses now
This is done by adding pausing_keep to the osd binds in mplayer's input.conf
-Changed: The page down icon now only shows, if there are at least more items than a page (10 items pr page) 

30/07/2012:
-Changed: the subtitle quick fix from initial commit has been updated, it looks more stable now

31/07/2012: 
-Added: Resume-playback function: if you stop a video in the middle of playing, it will save last position and resume from there if desired (more than a minute of video has to be played).

05/08/2012:
-Fixed: Osd_show_progression (x) only shows if osd-button (y) hasn't been pressed before
-Fixed: Smart Menu now support multiple devices
This means that the browser will be reset between devices
-Fixed: Lb and Rb doesn't seek -600/+600
Also changed the binds of "r" and "l" to "c" and "v" in input.conf (it didn't seem to detect lowercase l and r)
-Changed: Osd-button now switches from 1 to 3, this means it only needs 1 press to full osd and not 3 presses
-Changed: When pressing the pause-button (a) progression will also show
Bind "a" in input.conf needs to be "pausing_toggle osd_show_progression"
-Removed: Font folder and subtitle size, not needed anymore
Without font-folder the subfont.ttf works fine, with font-scale working
-Added: Support for multiple subtitle languages
Supported language depends on subcp, slang and font. See mplayer\config

06/08/2012:
-Fixed:The D-pad being buggy after a video has been played, every 2nd time you go out and in a menu it won't respond, but the A and B buttons work fine

09/08/2012:
-Added: All libmenu's working functions available in the main osd, so libmenu will no longer be needed

10/08/2012:
-Added: When quiting via libmenu or quit-button (b is binded to quit now), it will now save last position
-Added: Patch from mplayerdev's mailing list which adds support for playing videos inside multivolume uncompressed rar files
Haven't been tested intensively. 

13/08/2012:
-Changed: The B-button doesn't exit to homepage any more, it goes one level up, until root then goes to homepage
-Added: The Back-button goes directly back to homepage
-Added: [extension.rar] demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf <-- see 17/08/2012

17/08/2012:
-Removed: [extension.rar] demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf
-Changed: [extension.mp4] demuxer=mov to demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf, lavf handles .mp4 files better than mov
-Changed: have disabled libmenu, now that osd menu has the same functions, can cause instability
-Added: if a .rar file loads, it now gets the extension of the archived file, so the true extension profile is loaded

27/08/2012:
Added: Sort files. By pressing "x" in the file browser, you can order by Name or Date (day/month/year)

28/08/2012:
Changed: The audio delay option in osd is more logical, a audio_delay of 100 ms doesn't mean audio is 100 ms before video (mplayer standard), but 100 ms after

29/08/2012:
-Changed: Updated libass to 0.10.0
-Changed: ass/ssa is now subtitle default which means outline, color etc. works 
-Added: ass settings can be accessed from the subtitle osd menu (ass can be buggy, video freeze etc.)

04/09/2012:
-Changed: replaced mxml with tinyxml, because of loading problems and it seems lighter

05/09/2012:
-Fixed: some bugs with osd displaying delay as -0 because of it being close to zero
-Added: set ass=yes and vf=ass in mplayer config, with vf=ass it looks stable, haven't experienced freezes. This means it can be disabled and subfont can be used if wished

17/09/2012:
-Added: Global, audio, video and subtitles settings in menu (no need to play with mplayer config files anymore)

TODO:
-Get mplayer to seek through large files (>2gb)
